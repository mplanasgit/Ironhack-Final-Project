# Plan your trip: Forecasting seasonal pollutants
---

## 1- Context
- Air pollution is responsible for many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. 
- **Particulate Matter (PM)** are one of the causal agents of such diseases. These particles are not composed of a single pollutant but rather a mixture of many chemical species (solids and aerosols).
- PM are defined by their diameter (d) for air regulatory purposes:
- Those with a d < of 10 microns (PM10) are inhalable into the lungs and can induce adverse health effects, such as [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-(copd)).
- Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.
- Most PMs form in the atmosphere as a result of complex reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles.

#### In Europe, althoguh PM levels have slowly decreased over the years, COPD cases are steadily increasing

## 2- Main objectives
- To build an App to visualize PM10 historical data. 

> If PMs follow a seasonal behaviour, we could potentially avoid them by not visiting certain cities during specific periods of time.

- To investigate the seasonality of PM10 in Europe.

> Assuming PMs are seasonal, is it the same for all cities in Europe?

- To forecast levels of PM10 in European cities.
